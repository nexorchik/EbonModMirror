## Additions:
- New critters: Rams, Goats
- New blood moon enemies: Goat-head Fanatics, Cryptids 

## Changes:
- Reorganized the mod's codebase (this doesn't affect the mod in any direct way but there's a risk for oversights)
- Updated the Hookworm's spawn rate, coin drops, bestiary, and added a chance for it to drop a Whoopie Cushion

## Fixes:
- Fixed the Defibrillator's VFX being weirdly flat
- Fixed the Cold Touch spawning incorrectly
- Fixed "Sounds/GenericExplosion" being missing
- Fixed the Tittering's special Terrortoma stats always being applied
