	}

	Cecitior: {
		DisplayName: Cecitior
		Bestiary: A fleshy, haphazardly made construct. Despite looking akin to many other crimson monsters, this entity seems to have been created recently for an indiscernible purpose.
	}

	Terrortoma: {
		DisplayName: Terrortoma
		Bestiary: An unusual conglomerate of corrupted entities with the strange capability to show emotion. It is malformed, and not the intended result of the metamorphosis.
	}

	TerrorClingerSummoner.DisplayName: Clinger
	TerrorClingerRanged.DisplayName: Clinger

	TerrorClingerMelee: {
		DisplayName: Clinger

	}

	CrimsonWormTail.DisplayName: Gutworm

	CrimsonWormHead: {
		DisplayName: Gutworm
		Bestiary: Gutworms would appear to be a mimicry of the Corruption's famished eaters, down to the endless hunger and inundation of ichor. They are usually quite rare, making their appearances in this region concerning at lowest.
	}

	CrimsonWormBody.DisplayName: Gutworm
	CrimeraTail.DisplayName: Scorn

	CrimeraHead: {
		DisplayName: Scorn
		Bestiary: A Crimera that has begun to evolve in the Crimson's time of need. It's limbs can now tunnel, and it can hurl up some of the dead blood cells which it's body generates at a breakneck pace.
	}

	CrimeraBody.DisplayName: Scorn
	Crimera.DisplayName: Crimera

	VileSlime: {
		DisplayName: Muckling
		Bestiary: Resembling a slime, it uses its unassuming appearance to get close to any potential prey, and lashes out with a fast moving tentacle. It is worth noting that it isn't actually a slime at all.
	}

	RottenSpineTail.DisplayName: Rotten Spine

	RottenSpineHead: {
		DisplayName: Rotten Spine
		Bestiary: Corruption evolution has taken its worms in a curious direction, creating a purely aggressive worm with a head on either side. How it sustains itself is unknown.
	}

	RottenSpineBody.DisplayName: Rotten Spine
	EbonianStrider.DisplayName: Regurgitator

	EbonFly: {
		DisplayName: Ebonfly
		Bestiary: An insect that prefers to fly in groups. They feed by eating dead flesh off of other surfaces. Some say that one day they will grow too big for their wings and become the worms their homeland is known for. Whether this is true or not is debatable.
	}

	EbonCrawler: {
		DisplayName: Waster
		Bestiary: The Waster is a product of the Corruption's failures. It is an evolutionary mishap, that's only purpose now is to unwillingly be a nest for the Ebonflies.
	}

	CecitiorEye: {
		DisplayName: Gazer
		Bestiary:
			'''
			Ocular organs used by Cecitior. The creature is haphazardly created, leaving many flaws in its existence, such as the lack of defended eyes.

			'''
	}

	TinyBrain.DisplayName: Brain
	EbonianHeartNPC.DisplayName: Heart

	BabyCecity: {
		DisplayName: Crimorrhage
		Bestiary: An evolution of an Ichor Sticker that had its limbs overtaken by the spread of the biome. Despite their appearance, they have adapted well to their sporadic evolution and symbiosis, and use it to the fullest extent possible, even more so than the unhindered monster it once was.
	}

	Fleshformator: {
		DisplayName: Fleshformator
		Bestiary: Fleshformators are bottom-feeders of the deep crimson. When they are born, they roam from their starting spot and latch onto a nutrient-rich area to grab onto anything they can and devour it. None have ever seen what is on the other end of a Fleshformator.
	}

	LetsGoo: {
		DisplayName: Gnasher
		Bestiary: The Gnasher is nothing but muscle, jaws, and the instinctual desire to devour prey of any kind.

	DankDiggerBody.DisplayName: Dank Digger

	DankDiggerHead: {
		DisplayName: Dank Digger

	}

	DankDiggerTail.DisplayName: Dank Digger

	BloatedEbonfly: {
		DisplayName: Bloated Ebonfly
		Bestiary: A strange mutation of the Ebonfly. Eating something that has been lit ablaze by the cursed inferno, it has extended its natural lifespan, but also become far more volatile.
	}

	MassiveSpectator: {
		DisplayName: Massive Spectator
		Bestiary: These towering eyes seem to be connected to something at the very base of the Crimson. They only appeared very recently, so not much else is known about them.
		LowTaperFade: you know what else is massive?
	}

	TerrortomaBulb.DisplayName: Giant Cocoon

	Bloodhound: {
		DisplayName: Bloodhound

	}

	ClumpOfMeat: {
		DisplayName: Clump Of Meat
		Bestiary: Latchers are surprisingly clever entities, often bunching up in order to mimic other things, only to burst apart and bombard the enemy all at once. These usually come in the form of slimes, but a few rare cases have detailed them taking humanoid shapes.
	}

	Parasite: {
		DisplayName: Latcher
		Bestiary: These remnants of other crimson creatures are put to better use as small vessels to bring blood to more deserving crimson entities.
	}

	FleshBrickBig: {
		DisplayName: Sedimentary
		Bestiary: Sedimentaries are theorized to be walls of the corruption's casms at an early stage in development. Like everything else in the corruption, even the mud and stone you walk on can be traced to the hive-organism itself.
	}

	FleshBrickMedium.DisplayName: Sedimentary
	FleshBrickSmall.DisplayName: Sedimentary
	TrumpetTail.DisplayName: Trumpet

	TrumpetHead: {
		DisplayName: Trumpet
		Bestiary: A Trumpet's job within the corruption macroorganism is to tend to the fauna below it. Unlike most infected creatures, they seem completely unbothered by your presence.
	}

	TrumpetBody.DisplayName: Trumpet

	Rolypoly: {
		DisplayName: Rolypoly
		Bestiary:
			'''
			Bundled together, these corrupt worms share a collective and much greater mind at the cost of their mobility.
			However, by the time they become permanently entangled, their combined mind concludes that such a form is rather stupid.
			'''
	}

	JuvenileBrain: {
		DisplayName: Neurobite
		Bestiary: It uses a primitive form of neurokinesis to trick its prey into seeing mirror images of itself. This confusion allows the Neuromaw to strike while its target is vulnerable to attack.
	}

	WormKing: {
		DisplayName: Worm King
		Bestiary: The Worm King is the result of a Rolypoly left to grow unchecked. Acting as a hive mind, it controls the worm-like creatures of the corruption, with many adventurers mistaking it for a strange tree before meeting their end.
	}

	MiniTrumpetBody.DisplayName: Cornet
	MiniTrumpetHead.DisplayName: Cornet
	MiniTrumpetTail.DisplayName: Cornet

	Consumer: {
		DisplayName: Rotjaw
		Bestiary: Rotjaws are relentless and will dive towards their prey in the blink of an eye. Their bites can shatter large bones and durable shells effortlessly, and they often leave no scraps behind when devouring their prey.
	}

	Regorger: {
		DisplayName: Tittering
		Bestiary: A tittering's laugh echoes from afar, often fueling campfire tales that portray it as a mysterious cryptid. It remains unclear whether the creature's laughter is from genuine amusement or merely a biological reflex after spewing a beam of cursed flames.
	}

	Vileglider: {
		DisplayName: Vileglider
		Bestiary: Vilegliders strike when least expected, diving from above to swarm their prey. Their attacks are viciously precise, often leaving no trace of their victims behind.
	}

	ToxicAbomination: {
		DisplayName: Virulant
		Bestiary: It stores toxic gases from the carrion it consumes, using this buildup to launch itself at great speeds toward its next target, creating an explosion-like burst of force in the process.
	}

	VileTear: {
		DisplayName: Grinner
		Bestiary: The Grinner is a rare sight, but its imposing size and ever-present smile strikes fear into those encountering it. It takes as much pleasure in scaring its victims as it does in devouring them whole.
	}

	BloodHunter: {
		DisplayName: Blood Hunter
		Bestiary: A gruesome arachnid of the crimson. It prefers a less direct approach compared to its spider relatives, maintaining distance with its pincers, and a stinger tail producing a potent venom.
	}

	ArchmageXDeathAnim.DisplayName: Xareus
	Conglomerate.DisplayName: Conglomerate

	Mosquito: {
		DisplayName: Bloodsucker
		Bestiary: A once nuisance turned into another monster. These creatures' bloodsucking ability makes them annoying alone, but dangerous in swarms, or for what lasting side effects they may bring.
	}

	Screecher: {
		DisplayName: Shrieker
		Bestiary: Medium sized, skinless creatures that roam the crimson as walking alarms of a sort. Their nerves are nearly exposed, allowing them to sense even the slightest disturbance and alert the crimson to it.
	}

	ArchmageCutsceneMartian.DisplayName: Archmage Xareus

	ArchmageStaffNPC: {
		DisplayName: Archstaff
		Bestiary: Of all magical elements in the world, few are quite so great as the Archstaff. A handle forged of pure-iron and mythril, with spectral bars and fallen stars poured in, wrapped in the finest archcloth, and a massive gemstone of crystallized shimmer and amethyst, able to, unlike other staves, instantly transmutate mana into magical energies and otherworldly portals, rather than using it to get magical power out of the item itself. This staff, despite its wielder, is a testament to all things magical and a culmination of all of the history within the arts, dark and light alike.
	}

	FleshDice.DisplayName: Flesh Dice

	Sheep: {
		DisplayName: Sheep
		Bestiary: Sheep are passive, friendly animals with a thick layer of wool and an appetite for grass, sheep's wool is quite common in many colorful items of clothing and especially comfort, to the surprise of very few
	}

	JelleyeFish: {
		DisplayName: Jelleye Fish
		Bestiary: Fleshy tendrils drift afloat over the crimson's blood-spattered terrain. Originating from the sanguine waters of the crimson, these mutant abominations evolved to continuously grow numerous inconsolable eyes and float in the putrid air, not unlike their aquatic ancestors. Just don't make sashimi from these.
	}

	MiniSpectator: {
		DisplayName: Spectator
		Bestiary: An uncommon sight in the Crimson. In all recorded cases, Spectators have seemed to have no singular focus, analyzing crimson creatures, corruption creatures, and even pure creatures, with the same lack of intensity and eerie passiveness, to the point travelers claim they wish they could tell them jokes. Notably, the ones here are focused on you.
	}
