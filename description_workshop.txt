[h1]Ebonian Mod v1.1.2[/h1]
is [b]WIP[/b] Mod that plans on adding random nonsense with an unsurprising focus on... the Corruption and Crimson (They're far from everything though!)

[h3]If you encounter bugs, please report them in the Discord server below, replying to steam comments is incredibly inconvenient.[/h3]

[h2]Misc Info:[/h2] [list]
[*] [b]NO MULTIPLAYER COMPATIBILITY!!!!!!!!!!![/b]

[*] Despite the "1.x", the mod is far from finished, it's just stable enough to be considered a 1.0 release, and each major update will move on to 2.x, 3.x, etc.

[*] Join our [url=https://discord.gg/DexM5QuV7c]discord[/url] for updates and announcements!

[*] Currently the mod contains 4 bosses, over 85 items and 30 enemies, but it will grow with time.
